The idea is to get the sequences from the database CRUX has done to s
```{r libraries}
library (tidyverse)
library (here)
library (insect)
library (taxonomizr)
```

# 1. Load the fasta file and the insect version of ncbi taxonomy

```{r data}

Seqs <- readFASTA(here("analysis", "classifiers_to_use_in_insect", "insect_classifiers", "12S", "Global_.fasta"))

lineages <- read_delim(here("analysis", "classifiers_to_use_in_insect", "insect_classifiers", "12S", "Global_taxonomy.txt"), col_names = c("Accession", "lineage"), delim = "\t" )

lineages %>% 
  separate (lineage, sep = ";", into = LETTERS[1:7]) %>% 
  select (Accession, last.term = G) -> Conversion.df

```



# Create classifier
